        <!-- Description about me -->
        As you may know, my name is Annika! I am a fourth year BS in Computer Science student at the University of Denver. I am from 
        California, and I moved for the first time when I came to DU for college. I love Colorado, and at the moment, I am planning on
        staying here after graduation. This past summer I worked in Chile at El Centro De Inteligencia Terretorial as a programming intern.
        I speak Spanish, and this was a great opportunity to get me out of my comfort zone while also practicing my coding skills in a professional
        environment. Chile was amazing, I was able to explore a few different parts of it, and I definitely left a piece of my heart there.
        I currently work at Urban Outfitters in the Cherry Creek Mall, and I started working there in June 2022. The job is amazing
        for me, as I love clothes and I get 40%-60% off on clothes there! I also met some of my best friends while working at the 
        store, and I am super grateful for it! Working here is why I am so interested in fashion, as seeing all the clothes 
        and people inspire me.
